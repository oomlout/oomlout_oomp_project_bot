So many accelerometers and so little time! We've expanded our accelerometer selection even more with this high-precision and inexpensive MMA8451 Triple-Axis Accelerometer w/ 14-bit ADC. You can detect motion, tilt and basic orientation with a digital accelerometer - and the MMA8451 is a great accelerometer to start with. It has a wide usage range, from +-2g up to +-8g yet is easy to use with Arduino or another microcontroller  
  
The MMA8451 is a miniature little accelerometer from Freescale, who are (by this point) masters at the accelerometer-design game. It's designed for use in phones, tablets, smart watches, and more, but works just as well in your Arduino project. Of the MMA8451/MMA8452/MMA8453 family, the MMA8451 is the most precise with a built in 14-bit ADC. The accelerometer also has built in tilt/orientation detection so it can tell you whether your project is being held in landscape or portrait mode, and whether it is tilted forward or back
