KiCad-Logos
===========

LAYOUT FILES: Graphical things for KiCad / pcbnew in library form.

Sizes: 1..20mm for most logos.

Layers: silkscreen-front, silkscreen-back, copper-front, copper-back.

If necessary, the graphics are available in mirrored versions for the back-layers. Once inserted to your board, you only have to hover the curser above it and 'flip' the footprint by pressing 'f'.


Of course this collection is far from complete! And I don't intend it to be. 
Take it as an extended 'HOWTO' create your own library with ease.


Please note: 

This repo still uses the old '.mod' footprint library format, which is now considered
deprecated. You can still import, but not create now ones with current KiCad versions.

At one point this will have to be rewritten for the new '.pretty' format.
