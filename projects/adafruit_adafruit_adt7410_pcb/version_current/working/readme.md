--- Description  
  
Analog Devices, known for their reliable and well-documented sensor chips - has a high precision and high resolution temperature sensor on the market, and we've got a breakout to make it easy to use! The Analog Devices ADT7410 gets straight to the point - it's an I2C temperature sensor, with 16-bit 0.0078°C temperature resolution and 0.5°C temperature tolerance. Wire it up to your microcontroller or single-board computer to get reliable temperature readings with ease  
  
The ADT7410 has 2 address pins, so you can have up to 4 sensors on one I2C bus. There's also interrupt and critical-temperature alert pins. The sensor is good from 2.7V to 5.5V power and logic, for easy integration.  
  
We've got both [Arduino (C/C++)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adt7410-breakout/arduino) and [CircuitPython (Python 3)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adt7410-breakout/python-and-circuitpython) libraries available so you can [use it with any microcontroller like Arduino](https://learn.adafruit.com/adt7410-breakout/arduino), ESP8266, Metro, etc or with [Raspberry Pi or other Linux com
