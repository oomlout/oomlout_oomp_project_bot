Torn  
===============  
  
The split keyboard kit made with through hole components. The design has been inspired by the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), [Plaid](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid) and [Discipline](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline) keyboards.

Torn uses an Atmega328P cpu, running QMK with VUSB:  
- [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/torn/readme.md).  
- [Bootloader](https://github.com/rtitmuss/USBaspLoader).  
- Compatible with [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/)  
  
-- Building your own Torn keyboard  
  
Later this year you will be able to buy a Torn keyboard kit from [splitkb.com](https://blog.splitkb.com/blog/january-2021).  
Alternatively you can also buy [all the parts](./doc/bom.md) needed youself.  
  
Instructions are in the [Build guide](./doc/build.md) and [Troubleshooting guide](./doc/troubleshoot.md).  
You can ask questions and get help on the [Torn Discord channel](https://discord.gg/mamAqNccju).  
  
There is also a detailed [build log](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/buildlogs/blob/main/torn-v3.md)  
and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WUTQ30Datw). Thanks [rafaeldelboni](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni)!   
  
  
-- Thanks  
  
It would not have been possible for me to design Torn without the information and designs published by the mechanical keyboard community. So thanks go to ...
