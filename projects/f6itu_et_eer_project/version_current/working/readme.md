Envelope Tracking - Envelope Elimination/Restoration for high efficiency power amplifier   
  
This repository hosts several projects, all of them trying to enhance the efficiency of an RF power amplifier  
  
* The most advanced one is the result of the work of DJ1MR, using the OpenHPSDR firmware.   
* The DK7XL directory is a variant of this design  
* A second project, by Manfred XQ6FOD, is still under development. Also based on an OpenHPSDR compatible firmware writtent by Pavel Demin  
and dedicated to Red Pitaya users.   
* A specific subdirectory hosts a conversation (email thread in pdf format) between the main ET/EER experimenters(DJ1MR, K1LI, VK6PH). A careful reading of   
this technical discussion is recommanded to understand the many hindrances (and proposed solutions) of such a project.  
  
This subdirectory also contains the datasheet of an evaluation board sold by GAN systems. This board could be a replacement for the   
PWM command & control of the power supply   
  
A preliminary reading of the Tor project wiki page is also highly recommanded
