Simple shield to connect an HD44780-compatible, 16x2 LCD module to an  
Arduino or compatible such as a Freetronics TwentyTen.  
  
Features:  
  
 * Reset button connected to Arduino reset pin.  
 * 100nF smoothing capacitor.  
 * Buttons for "up", "down", "left", "right", and "select" all on a  
   single analog input pin.  
 * Parts overlay on both the top and the bottom so you can see what you  
   are connecting without having to keep turning the board over.
