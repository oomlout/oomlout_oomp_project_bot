--- Description  
  
Thermocouples are very sensitive, requiring a good amplifier with a cold-compensation reference. The Adafruit MCP9601 I2C Thermocouple Breakout (a.k.a MCP96L01) does all that for you and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller or single-board computer with I2C. Inside, the chip handles all the analog stuff for you, and can interface with just about any thermocouple type: K, J, T, N, S, E, B, and R types are all supported! You can also set various alerts for over/under temperature, and read the thermocouple (hot) temperature and the chip (cold) temperature. All this over common I2C.  
  
This breakout board has the chip itself, a 3.3V regulator and level shifting circuitry, all assembled and tested. Works great with 3.3V or 5V logic. Comes with a 2-pin terminal block (for connecting to the thermocouple) and pin header (to plug into any breadboard or perfboard). Match it up with our 1m K-type thermocouple.  
  
Works with any K, J, T, N, S, E, B, and R type thermocouple  
Datasheet rated for:  
K Type: -200째C to +1372째C  
J Type: -150째C to +1200째C
