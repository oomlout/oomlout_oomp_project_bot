- CatFinder  
  
  
The Electronic Cats along with The Inventor's House have developed a new development kit for a Mars Rover in which almost everyone can participate  
  
"The CatFinder" is an exploration vehicle that collects data from the environment in which it travels.

The CatFinder Rover is cappable of transmit:  
  
- Humidity  
- Atmosphere pressure  
- Temperature   
- CO2 levels in ppm  
- TVOC levels in ppb   
- Position with acelerometer and gyroscope  
- Video broadcasting.  
  
Yes! we're capable of getting data, control the motors and transmitting video, through WiFi thanks to the ESP32-CAM and the [Bast Pro Mini](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/Bast-Pro-Mini-M0) (Which is a devBoard fully compatible with the Arduino Pro Mini).
