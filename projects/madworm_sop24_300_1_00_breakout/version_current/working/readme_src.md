SOP24_300_1.00_breakout
=======================

LAYOUT FILES: Simple breakout board for SOP24-300-1.00 chips (like MBI5030)

Most likely this adapter will only work for the Macroblock chip, as the 1.00mm
pin-pitch is non-standard it seems.

If you think about using this board, I suggest editing the gerber files and
removing all bridge-wires you don't need before having it made (e.g. with gerbv).
Cutting the bridges is a hell of a job. They ARE tiny.

Before having PC-boards made, please make sure you know about your manufacturer's peculiarities!
Especially drill-sizes and their tolerances may vary too much and give you trouble.
