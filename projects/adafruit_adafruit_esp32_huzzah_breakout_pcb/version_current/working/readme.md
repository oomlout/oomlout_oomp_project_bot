--- Description  
  
Squeeeeze down your next ESP32 project to its bare-bones essential with the **Adafruit HUZZAH32 Breakout**. This breakout is basically the 'big sister' of our HUZZAH 8266, but instead of an ESP8266 it has the '32! We've pared down our popular [Feather ESP32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405), removing the battery charger and USB-serial converter. You just get a regulator, some protection diodes, two buttons and an LED. For some projects, where price and size are at a premium, you can program this board over the 'FTDI cable' breakout when needed, and leave it alone otherwise.  
  
Note that this board doesn't come with a USB to serial converter chip and auto-reset circuit. Instead, you will need to plug in a [CP2104 Friend](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3309) or [FTDI cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/70). Then, before uploading code, put it into bootloader mode by holding down the GPIO -0 button and clicking Reset button, then releasing the -0 button.  
  
That module in the middle of the breakout contains a dual-core ESP32 chip, 4 MB of SPI Flash, tuned antenna, and all the passives you need to take advantage of this powerful new processor. The ES
