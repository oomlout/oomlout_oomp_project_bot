--- Description  
  
Add motion, direction and orientation sensing to your Arduino project with this all-in-one 9-DOF sensor. Inside the chip are three sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity) or how fast the board is accelerating in 3D space. The other is a 3-axis magnetometer that can sense where the strongest magnetic force is coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north. The third is a 3-axis gyroscope that can measure spin and twist. By combining this data you can REALLY orient yourself.  
  
We've carried the LSM9DS0 from ST for a while, and the LSM9DS1 is their latest offering. We thought this could really make for a great breakout, at a very nice price! Design your own activity or motion tracker with all the data... We spun up a breakout board that has all the extra circuitry you'll want, for use with an Arduino (or other microcontroller).
