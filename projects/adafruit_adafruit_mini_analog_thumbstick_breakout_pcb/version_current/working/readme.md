Are you itching for an easy way to mount a PSP-like thumb joystick to your project? This Analog Mini Thumbstick Breakout Board will help you do just that!  
  
This is a neat little PCB, on which you can mount a joystick/thumbstick -- we recommend this one. Since it's analog, you'll need two analog reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y.  
  
We designed the breakout so that you can attach the thumbstick to a panel easily. A 4-pin 0.1" spaced header makes it easy to connect either in a perfboard/breadboard setting or free wiring, with header on both siders it is mechanically stable. You'll need to solder a thumbstick into the PCB using a soldering iron and solder, but its very simple and will only take a minute.  
  
Includes 1 x 8-pin 0.1 inch male header. Note: Thumbstick itself is not included.
