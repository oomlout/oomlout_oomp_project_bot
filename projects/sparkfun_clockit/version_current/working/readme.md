[*SparkFun ClockIt (KIT-10930)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10930)  
  
This is a great kit to learn the basics of soldering. The SparkFun ClockIt is a basic alarm clock with buzzer based on the ever popular ATMega328.   
If you’re just learning how to solder, this kit should take you 15-20 minutes.   
If you’re a weathered pro at soldering, this is a great relaxing build that should take 5-10 minutes.
