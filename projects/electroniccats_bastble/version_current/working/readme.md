- Bast BLE  
  
Bast BLE is all the best in the world format Feather and BLE with a Nordic NRF!, Feather pin to pin compatible with a USB port type C.  
  
Bast-BLE is supported in the Arduino development environment and Circuit Python coming soon  
  
We love all our Feathers equally, but this Feather is very special. It's our first Feather that is specifically designed for use with CircuitPython! CircuitPython is our beginner-oriented flavor of MicroPython - and as the name hints at, its a small but full-featured version of the popular Python programming language specifically for use with circuitry and electronics.  
  
Please note, CircuitPython does not come preloaded. See the full guide linked below for instructions on installing it  
  
Lipoly battery and USB cable not included (but we do have lots of options in the shop if you'd like!)
