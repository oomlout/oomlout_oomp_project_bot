- 50W_RF_Amp, Codename Diomedes  
  
Diomedes is a 47 dBm (50W) HF amplifier designed by Manfred XQ6FOD, and intended to be used with any baseband SDR delivering no more than 5 to 10 dBm of  output power between 1 and 54 MHz.

This github repository only serves to simplify the work of people who want to build this amplifier. It offers  them the Gerber files and the KiCad implementation of this project.  
  
Thank you, Manfred, for the many developments you’ve done around the Red Pitaya board, and especially for your work on the EER support. It’s a « must read »… at least.  
  
  
This amplifier is designed to follow a 14 or 16 bit Red Pitaya board or any barefoot DDC/DUC SDR board. It completes the series of devices constituting the Alexiares frontend developed by the OpenHPSDR group

and replaces advantageously the old and outdated  Pennywhistle linear amplifier

It should be noted that board's dimensions and mounting holes are completely compatible with Pennywhistle physical and mechanical design. In fact, Diomedes has been designed as a substitute amplifier.
