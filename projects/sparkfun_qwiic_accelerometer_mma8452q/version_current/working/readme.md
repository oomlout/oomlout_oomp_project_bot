The Qwiic Accelerometer makes it extremely easy to get playing with tilt, acceleration, and movement sensing. Plug a [Qwiic Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=qwiic) onto your platform of choice, plug the Qwiic Accelerometer onto the shield and start sensing!   
  
The Qwiic Accelerometer - MMA8452Q is a smart low-power, three-axis, MEMS accelerometer with 12 bits of resolution. This accelerometer is packed with embedded functions with flexible user programmable options, configurable to two interrupt pins. Embedded interrupt functions allow for overall power savings relieving the host processor from continuously polling data.  
  
The MMA8452Q has user selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g with high pass filtered data as well as non filtered data available real-time. The device can be configured to generate inertial wake-up interrupt signals from any combination of the configurable embedded functions allowing the MMA8452Q to monitor events and remain in a low power mode during periods of inactivity.
