- Ch55xduino: Small Devices Arduino for ch55x devices  
  
-- Arduino core for the CH55x Family  
  
This project brings support for the CH55X chip to the Arduino environment. It lets you write sketches, using familiar Arduino functions and libraries, and run them directly on CH55X, with no external microcontroller required.  
  
Based in the work of [CH55xduino](https://github.com/DeqingSun/ch55xduino)

**Getting started on the Ch55x the easy way. Forked from Sduino project, also based on   
ch554_sdcc project**  
  
Ch55xduino is an Arduino-like programming API for the CH55X, a family of low-cost MCS51 USB MCU. The project tries to remove the difficulty of setting up a compiling environment. Users can simply write code in Arduino IDE and hit one button to flash the chip to get code running. No configuration or guesswork needed.   
  
CH551, CH552, CH554, may be the lowest part count system that works with Arduino. The
