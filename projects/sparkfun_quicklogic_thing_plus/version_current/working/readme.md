The SparkFun QuickLogic Thing Plus [EOS&trade; S3](https://www.quicklogic.com/products/eos-s3/), is a small form factor system ideal for enabling the next generation of low-power Machine Learning (ML) devices. The QuickLogic Thing Plus is powered by QuickLogicâ€™s EOS S3, the first eFPGA-enabled Arm Cortex&copy;-M4F MCU to be fully supported with Zephyr RTOS and FreeRTOS. Unlike other development boards which are based on proprietary hardware and software tools, the QuickLogic Things Plus is based on 100% open source hardware, compatible with the Feather form factor, and is built around 100% open source software (with support for FreeRTOS, Zephyr, nMingen, Docker, and SymbiFlow).   
  
Between the onboard LiPo battery connector and charging circuitry, wake-on-sound PDM microphone, and low-power, three-axis accelerometer, this Thing Plus board is ideal for wearable, voice, gesture sensing applications. The strong firmware support for the microphone and accelerator make it easy to move sensor data into the embedded FPGA. From there, you can use SensiML, TensorFlow Lite, or other tools to train and run embedded machine lea
