AVR-ISP_level-shifter  
=====================  
  
LAYOUT FILES: Bidirectional level-shifter for old 5V-only AVR-ISP programmers  
	      (or for ones that claim to do 3.3V and only offer that on VCC - not on I/O).

Before having PC-boards made, please make sure you know about your manufacturer's peculiarities!  
Especially drill-sizes and their tolerances may vary too much and give you trouble.
