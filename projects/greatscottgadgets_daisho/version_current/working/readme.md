Daisho  
======  
  
Daisho is a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 FPGA platform.  The Daisho Platform is intended  
for operation as a pair of components:  
  
A mainboard with an FPGA can connect to a back-end computer via SuperSpeed USB.  
  
A front-end board for a particular application connects to the mainboard via a  
high speed parallel connector.  
  
Front-end boards are planned that enable in-line monitoring and injection for  
high speed wired communication media.
