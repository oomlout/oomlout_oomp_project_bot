The iCEBreaker FPGA board is a low cost, open-source educational FPGA  
development board.  
  
The main motivating application of this board is for classes and workshops  
teaching the use of the open source FPGA design flow using  
[Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/),  
[nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr),  
[icestorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/),  
[iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/),  
[symbiflow](https://github.com/SymbiFlow) and others. This means the board has  
to be low cost and have a nice set of features to allow for the design of  
interesting classes and workshop exercises. At the same time we want to allow  
the user to use the proprietary vendor tools if they choose to. Because of that  
we need to be compatible with their firmware upload tools.
