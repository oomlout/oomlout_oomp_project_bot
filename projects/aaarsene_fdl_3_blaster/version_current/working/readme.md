**Speed**<br>  
Value: 0 - 100 : Default: 50<br>  
Speed or power setting used to adjust the velocity the blaster fires darts.<br><br>  
  
**ROF (Rate of Fire)**<br>  
Value: 0 - 100 : Default: 100<br>  
Rate of fire setting to adjust time between each dart fired when in burst or full auto.<br><br>  
  
**Burst**<br>  
Value: 1, 2, 3, F : Default: 1<br>  
Number of darts fired per single trigger pull. F (full auto) will continue firing darts until you release the trigger.<br><br>  
  
**MinSpin (Minimum Spinup)**<br>  
Value: 120 - 500 : Default: 220<br>  
Time in milliseconds for motors to spinup between trigger pull and firing dart when speed set to 0.<br><br>  
  
**MaxSpin (Maximum Spinup)**<br>  
Value: 150 - 500 : Default: 200<br>  
Time in milliseconds for motors to spinup between trigger pull and firing dart when speed set to 100.  
Note: MinSpin and MaxSpin together create a range of spinup time. When speed is set to 50, spinup time is half way between MinSpin and MaxSpin. Eg. MinSpin = 200, MaxSpin = 300, Speed =
