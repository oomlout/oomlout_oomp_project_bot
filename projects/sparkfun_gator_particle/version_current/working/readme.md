An I<sup>2</sup>C sensor for detecting particles. Additionaly, the MAX30102 sensor can also be used for measure heart-rate and SpO<sub>2</sub> using special algorithms. These algorithms have limited functionality and are primarily meant for demonstration purposed.

Instead of using pin connections or requiring soldering, this product provides connection pads for a more kid freindly experience with alligator clips. The design intention of this product is to be used with the [gato:bit (v2)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15162), and the [micro:bit development board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14208).
