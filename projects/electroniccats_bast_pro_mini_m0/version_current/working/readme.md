-- Installation  
  
While the SAMD21 alone is powerful enough, what truly makes it special is its growing support in the Arduino IDE. With just a couple click's, copies, and pastes, you can add ARM Cortex-M0+-support to your Arduino IDE.   
  
First of all we'll need to install the Arduino SAMD based boards, to do it you just need to go (Tools > Board > Boards Manager...)
