The SparkFun QwiicBus EndPoint is the fastest and easiest way to extend the range of your I<sup>2</sup>C communication bus. The breakout uses NXPâ€™s PCA9615 IC, which converts the two default I<sup>2</sup>C signals into four differential signals, two for SCL and two for SDA. The differential signals are sent over an Ethernet cable, which attaches to the breakout through the on-board RJ-45 connectors The differential signaling allows the I<sup>2</sup>C signals to reach distances of up to 100ft. while still maintaining their signal integrity! To make it even easier to get your readings, all communication is enacted exclusively via I<sup>2</sup>C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system so no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system. However, we still have broken out 0.1"-spaced pins in case you prefer to use a breadboard.  
  
The simplicity of the QwiicBus EndPoint is one of its biggest appeals. Other I<sup>2</sup>C communication methods require packetizing I<sup>2</sup>C communication into another protocol, be it RS-485 or 1-Wire. However, the PCA9615 keeps the I<sup>2</sup>C protocol by utilizing a differential transceiver.
