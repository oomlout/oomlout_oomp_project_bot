**Quick summary**  
  
This is a simple self-bootable ADAU1450, ADAU1451, or ADAU1452 based DSP board with 4 I2S (TDM/left and right justified and more) input and 4 output connectors. When used with the ADAU1451 and ADAU1452 parts there are also optical and coaxial SPDIF input and output connectors.   
  
There is an I2C/SPI connector for connection to the Analog Devices SigmaStudio USBi to EZ-Board Adapter (ADZS-USBI2EZB) or anything that will do the same job (eg freeUSBi). The board also features master and slave SPI connectors for use with other OHDSP boards. The board has space for a self-boot EEPROM and so with the ADZS-USBI2EZB or compatible device the board can be programmed as you wish and will selfboot the last program written when enabled.   
  
This board forms the core of the open hardware DSP platform which is designed to be a highly customisable and flexible DSP platform.
