SparkFun Charm High Desktop Pick and Place  
========================================  
  
![SparkFun Low Cost Desktop Pick and Place Machine](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/home_page_posts/2/5/8/6/Pick-Place-Setup-1.jpg)  
  
The CHMT36VA is a $2800 desktop sized pick and place machine from Charm High. We use it to produce a variety of designs, 50 to 100pcs at a shot. It works very well for low-volume high-mix pick and place of 0603 based designs.  
  
The main purposed of this repo is the [Eagle Conversion ULP](https://github.com/sparkfunX/Desktop-PickAndPlace-CHMT36VA/tree/master/Eagle-Conversion) and the English Language file. The Conversion ULP offers the user a GUI that looks like this:  
  
![Conversion GUI](https://github.com/sparkfunX/Desktop-PickAndPlace-CHMT36VA/raw/master/Conversion%20GUI.jpg)  
  
This allows the user to take in an Eagle BRD file and output the recipe file that the CHMT36VA expects. This cuts down on setup time of the machine dramatically.  
  
The [English Language conversion file](https://github.com/sparkfunX/Desktop-PickAndPlace-CHMT36VA/tree/master/Language-File) is our translation and typo fixes of the Charm High provided english file.
