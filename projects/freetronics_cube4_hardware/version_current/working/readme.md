The Cube is a USB powered, smart RGB LED Cube kit, with a serial command  
interface for direct control and learning, an open source driver library  
and an on-board Arduino compatible MCU running the whole show!  
  
The Cube was designed using the open source KiCad schematic and pcb  
design package: http://www.kicad-pcb.org  
  
The schematic pages have been carefully laid out to make it easy to follow and  
learn about a larger microcontroller based project design in operation.  
  
Features:  
  
 * Power and control by USB commands straight from your computer (Windows, Mac or Linux)  
 * Expansion port connector for sensors, joysticks, game and interface add ons  
 * Onboard ATmega32u4 MCU (Arduino Leonardo compatible)  
 * USB interface for uploading new sketches and sending serial commands  
 * Arduino driver library with example programs and animations at:  
   https://github.com/freetronics/Cube4  
 * Includes ZigBee/XBee headers so you can add a wireless module (not included)  
 * Prototyping area with I2C, power and spare pins next to it

This project is made up of 3 schematic and pcb project folders.  
Each folder within this repository includes a handy copy of the  
schematic in PDF format and image(s) of the main pcb.
