Qwiic Boost increases the Qwiic bus from 3.3V to 5V while still providing the target device with 3.3V I2C signals. This is a handy board for connecting technologies that still require 5V for running higher voltage mechanisms (like a DC fan) but have an internal processor running at 3.3V. We've seen this a lot with air quality sensors that use a fan to push air into a test chamber.
