What's a wearable project without LEDs? Our favorite part of the Flora platform is these tiny smart pixels. Designed specifically for wearables, [we found the brightest RGB LEDs available (an eye-blistering ~3800mcd)](http://adafruit.com/products/619) and paired them with a constant-current driver chip that sits on the back. The pixels are chainable - so you only need 1 pin/wire to control as many LEDs as you like. They're easy to sew, and the chainable design means no crossed threads.  
  
__This is the first/original version of the Flora NeoPixels, which runs at at 'low speed' 400KHz communication.__ Unfortunately they are not forward-compatible with [the fully-integrated 'high speed' (800KHz) Flora NeoPixel V2's](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1260). If you have a project that already uses high speed pixels, and you want to attach more pixels to the chain, [you will need to purchase version 2's](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1260) as these are not cross-compatible. __If you don't have any pixels in your project yet, [we suggest purchasing v2 pixels](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1260) as they are lower cost and v1's will eventually be discontinued.__  
  
These pixels have full 24-bit color ability with PWM taken care of
