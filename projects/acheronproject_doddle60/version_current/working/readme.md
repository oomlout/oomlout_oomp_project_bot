-- Introduction  
  
**Doddle**. *British slang for something easily accomplished*.  
  
The Doddle60 is a 60% plain-style PCB aimed at ISO layout users. It features minimal layout support and no LED backlight support. It runs an STM32F072 processor, USBC connector, ESD protection on both data lines and metallic case discharge, as well as overvoltage and overcurrent protection.  
  
The layout was cherry-picked and hinited to me by Jae of the TopClack channel, an avid ISO user brit.
