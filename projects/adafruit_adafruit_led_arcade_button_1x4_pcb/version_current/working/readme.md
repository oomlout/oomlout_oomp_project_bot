--- Description  
  
The only thing better than a glowy arcade button is, perhaps, FOUR glowing arcade buttons - and that's what the Adafruit LED Arcade Button 1x4 QT I2C Breakout will let you do! This long 3" x 0.8" PCB has 8 x JST XH sockets that will fit our arcade button quick connects. Each XH pair lets you connect one arcade button that has a built in LED illuminator, and makes it easy to use with a breadboard/perfboard or with a STEMMA QT (Qwiic) connector for instant I2C connectivity on any platform.
