See [this page](https://gondolindrim.github.io/AcheronDocs/fluxon/intro.html) for the Fluxon PCB documentation (still not written yet as of june of 2020).  
  
-- Introduction  
  
The Fluxon is a replacement PCB for the Vortex Core keyboard. It supports the default layouts of the Vortex Core, with a 1.75-2.75 split spacebar. The PCB also supports two extra bottom row layouts: one with a 6.25 spacebar one and other with a 7 unit spacebar. See the picture below for details.   
  
The PCB is powered by a STM32L072CxTx and is QMK compatible.  
  
The indicator LEDs of the stock PCB were substituted by SK6812 (WS2812-compatible controller-integrated seriallized RGB LEDs) which can be configured as per the QMK capabilities.
