Power distribution and regulation board for robotics applications  
  
-- Specs:  
* Main Bus Voltage Range of 30V - 60V, 6 Channels  
* X2 Regulated bus voltage Module, 6 Channels each  
* STM32F091RCT6 ARM Cortex M0 Monitoring Voltage on all channels and current  
  
  
  
-- Details  
The power board is designed to supply three bus voltages to the system.  
The main bus voltage is whatever the input is, with the PCB supporting a  
range of 30V-60V. This main bus voltages feeds the two other sections,  
which are sockets for Regulated Bus Voltage Modules.  
  
---- Regulated Bus Voltage Module (RBVM)
