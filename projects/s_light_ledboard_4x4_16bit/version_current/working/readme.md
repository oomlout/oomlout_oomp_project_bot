- LED-Board 4x4 16bit  
![LED-Board front](./export/3d/LEDBoard_4x4_16bit_3d_rendering.png)  
  
a LED-Matrix Board that can be combined seamlessly to bigger areas.    
It uses the [TI TLC5971](http://www.ti.com/product/TLC5971) Constant-Current LED-Driver Chip with 16bit dimming resolution.    
  
The [original](https://github.com/s-light/LEDBoard_4x4_16bit/tree/Nichia_NSSM032A) LED-footprint was for [Nichia NSSM032A](http://www.nichia.co.jp/en/product/led_product_data.html?type=%27NSSM032A%27) RGB-LED.  
Back in 2017 on of the brightest *low power* SMD LEDs in this size -  
They are only available as full reel directly from Nichia.  
  
so there is a [second branch](https://github.com/s-light/LEDBoard_4x4_16bit/tree/Nichia_NSSM124D) with the LED-Type changed to [Nichia NSSM124D](http://www.nichia.co.jp/en/product/led_product_data.html?type=%27NSSM124D%27) -  
these are [available as cut-tape from an distributor](http://www.leds.de/en/Ordinary-LEDs/SMD-LEDs/Nichia-SMD-LED-RGB-NSSM124DT.html).  
  
latest addition is a [branch with TLC5971*PWP* driver chips](https://github.com/s-light/LEDBoard_4x4_16bit/tree/TLC5971PWP) -  
this is the same chip but in an HTSSOP-20 housing -  
that is easier to solder by hand.  
--> no hot air / reflow oven necessary, but recommend.
