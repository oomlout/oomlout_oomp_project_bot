--- Description  
  
Connect your Arduino-compatible to the Internet with this WiFi shield that features the FCC-certified ATWINC1500 module from Atmel. This 802.11bgn-capable WiFi module is the best new thing for networking your devices, with SSL support and rock solid performance - running our adafruit.io MQTT demo for a full weekend straight with no hiccups (it would have run longer but we had to go to work, so we unplugged it).  
  
The Adafruit ATWINC1500 WiFi Shield uses SPI to communicate plus some GPIO for control, so with about 6 wires, you can get your wired up and ready to go. Right now the Atmel-supplied library works best with SAMD21-based boards like the Arduino Zero or Metro M0 Express or M4s, or the Arduino Mega. It will not work/fit on other Arduinos such as 328P or 32u4-based or attiny-based boards. You can clock it as fast as 12MHz for speedy, reliable packet streaming. And scanning/connecting to networks
