Leveraging the ultra powerful Artemis Module, the SparkFun MicroMod Artemis Processor is the brain board of your dreams. Need Machine Learning capabilities? We gotcha. Need Bluetooth? We gotcha. Need I<sup>2</sup>C functionality to connect to all our amazing Qwiic boards? We totally gotcha.    
  
At the heart of SparkFun's Artemis module is Ambiq Micro's Apollo3 processor, whose ultra-efficient ARM Cortex-M4F processor is specâ€™d to run TensorFlow Lite using only 6uA/MHz. We've routed 2 I<sup>2</sup>C buses, 8 GPIO, dedicated digital, analog, and PWM pins, multiple SPI as well as QuadSPI, and Bluetooth to boot. You really can't go wrong with this processor. Grab one today, pick up a compatible carrier board, and get hacking!
