Better than ever, our Adafruit assembled GPS shield comes with an Ultimate GPS module. This GPS shield works great with either Adafruit Metro, Arduino UNO or Leonardo and is designed to log data to an SD card. Or you can leave the SD card out and use the GPS for a geocaching project, or maybe a music player that changes tunes depending on where you are in the city.  
   
- -165 dBm sensitivity, 10 Hz updates, 66 channels  
- Low power module - only 20mA current draw, half of most GPS's  
- Assembled & tested shield for Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila/Leonardo (not for use with Mega/ADK/Due)  
- MicroSD card slot for datalogging onto a removable card  
- RTC battery included, for up to 7 years backup  
- Built-in datalogging to flash  
- PPS output on fix  
- Internal patch antenna + u.FL connector for external active antenna  
- Power, Pin -13 and Fix status LED  
- Big prototyping area
