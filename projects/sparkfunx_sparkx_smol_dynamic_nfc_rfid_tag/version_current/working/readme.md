You might be wondering why we would make an NFC/RFID tag peripheral board for smôl? The STMicroelectronics ST25FV64KC is a _**dynamic**_ Near Frequency Communication / Radio Frequency Identification tag IC with 64Kbit (8KByte) of on-board EEPROM memory. It has an I<sup>2</sup>C interface which the smôl processor board can use to read and write to the EEPROM memory. But the memory can also be read and written to over the RF link _while your smôl ecosystem is in deep sleep_! This means it is perfect for: contactless data storage and collection; and for configuration.
