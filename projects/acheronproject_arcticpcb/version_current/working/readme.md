-- Introduction  
  
Arctic is an STM32F072-based universal 60% keyboard PCB featuring limited layouts and features. The layouts were cherry-picked by enthusiast ArcticFox and consist of only Tsangan bottom row.   
  
This PCB also features "relief" flex cuts aimed at improving keyboard typing feeling.  
  
Arctic hold a very special place in my heart as it was one of the first two PCBs, together with the KeebsPCB, in the Acheron Project and effectively inaugurated it.  
  
-- Contributors  
  
- Raphael "ArcticFox" Hochheim for helping choosing the compatible layouts  
- Felipe 'MrKeebs" Coury who paid for the V1 prototypes and helped immensely by funcing my learning  
- PCBWay for sponsoring the pre-revision Alpha prototypes
