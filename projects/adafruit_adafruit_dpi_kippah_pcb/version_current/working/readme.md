--- DESCRIPTION  
A TFT panel connected to a Raspberry Pi without the use of an HDMI decoder? What is this sorcery??? It's the DPI Kippah from Adafruit! This HAT-like* board snaps onto a Raspberry Pi B+, A+, Pi 2, Pi 3 or Zero and with a little software configuration, allows you to have what normally would go out the HDMI port come up on a nice little flat screen. *Its not technically a HAT due to the lack of an on-board EEPROM, but its the same shape as a Pi HAT and its a covering of sorts, so we call it a kippah  
  
This is the Kippah with resistive touch support. If you don't need a touchscreen then here's our super low-cost version of the Kippah without the USB touchscreen capability.  
  
Compared to our lovely HDMI backpacks, you don't have the extra cost or expense of an HDMI encoder/decoder. And you get a nice ultra-fast 18-bit color display with optional touch support. We tested it and it works great wit
