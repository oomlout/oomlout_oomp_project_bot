- LEDEAF  
  
A modular LED light inspired by [@GeekMomProjects]' project. Compared to the  
original, this version:  
  
* is drawn from scratch in KiCad  
* uses the attaching bolts for electrical contact, instead of spring contacts  
* only requires one acrylic sheet per triangle  
* all LEDs on each panel are driven by the same input data
