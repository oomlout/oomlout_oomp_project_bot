The Qwiic Distance Sensor uses the RFD77402 sensor utilizing VCSEL or vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and a 3 pixel camera to measure the amount of time to a target. This gives you amazing millimeter prescision with low-cost and low power.  
  
Library is available [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RFD77402_Arduino_Library).  
  
The [Qwiic system](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) enables fast and solderless connection between popular platforms and various sensors and actuators. You can read more about the Qwiic system [here](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).
