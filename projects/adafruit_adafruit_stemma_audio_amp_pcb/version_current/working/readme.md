--- Description  
  
The Adafruit STEMMA Audio Amp is a super small mono amplifier is surprisingly powerful - able to deliver up to 2.5 Watts into 4-8 ohm impedance speakers. Inside the miniature chip is a class D controller, able to run from 2.0V-5.5VDC. Since the amp is a class D, its very efficient (over 90% efficient when driving an 8Î© speaker at over half a Watt) - making it perfect for portable and battery-powered projects. It has built in thermal and over-current protection but we could barely tell it got hot. There's even a volume trim pot so you can adjust the volume on the board down from the default 24dB gain. This board is a welcome upgrade to basic "LM386" amps!  
  
This board is a simplified version of our breadboard-friendly Adafruit Mono 2.5W Class D Audio Amplifier board. This version is designed to be 'plug and play' - with no soldering required. You can input the audio via the JST-PH 3 Pin connector - such as a pin header cable or one with alligator clips. The trade-off is that this board doesn't have differential inputs, instead the audio inputs are referenced to the power/signal ground wire.  
  
The input to the amplifier goes through 1.0uF cap
