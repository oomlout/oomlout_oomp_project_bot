Based on the circuit described in the "RFID Access Control" project in  
the book "Practical Arduino", this shield allows you to control a door  
lock using an electric strike plate using a number of commonly  
available RFID reader modules.  
  
Supported reader modules include:  
  
 * ID12  
 * ID20  
 * RDM630  
 * RDM880  
 * HF MultiTag  
  
Features:  
  
 * Reset button wired through to Arduino reset pin.  
 * Blue "Arduino power on" LED with current-limiting resistor.  
 * 100nF bypass/smoothing capacitor on supply rails.  
 * Overlay guide where you need it: both top and bottom.  
  
Compatible with the Freetronics TwentyTen, Arduino Uno, Arduino  
Duemilanove, and other compatible boards based on the same header  
format.
