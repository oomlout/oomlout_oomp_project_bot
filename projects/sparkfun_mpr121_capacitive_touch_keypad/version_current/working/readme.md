The MPR121 capacitive keypad uses the MPR121 and 12 touch sensitive pads to give you a simple 'keypad' with an I2C output. The board   
also has four mounting holes allowing it to be used as na input system in place of traditional buttons.   
  
Note: This is uses 3.3V logic. You will want to use a logic level converter with this for 5V systems.
