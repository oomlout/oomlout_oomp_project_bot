This is the PCB and small parts pack from original V1 Cupcade. These parts were used with the original "Raspberry Pi 1" design, not the version for Pi A+, 2, 3, or Zero!  
  
Great for anyone who needs a replacement PCB or wants to mod or build out their Cupcade.   
  
PCB files for the Adafruit Cupcade Adapter. The format is EagleCAD schematic and board layout
