--- Description  
  
  
Long gone are the days of parallel ports and serial ports. Now the USB port reigns supreme! But USB is hard, and you just want to transfer your every-day serial data from a microcontroller to computer. What now? Enter the Adafruit CP2102N Friend!  
  
The CP2102N is very similar to the CP2104. Despite having a name with a lower number, its actually considered the successor/next generation to the CP2104. Compared to the CP2104, the CP2102N can:  
  
* Transfer data at a faster rate: CP2104 is 2Mbps max, the CP2102N is 3Mbps max  
Reprogram the internal settings: CP2104 has a one-time-programmable memory and the CP2102N has reprogrammable settings memory. 99% of people don't use this capability but it is there if you need it.  
* The CP2102N improves over the CP2012 (no N) by having the same RS-485 and GPIO support that the CP2104 has  
* More details in the SiLabs CP2104 to CP2102N migration guide.  
* We've also updated this breakout from our CP2104 Friend so that it has USB C instead of Micro B. It is otherwise 'drop in compatible' and anywhere you would use the CP2104 for uploading firmware to microcontr
