Bluetooth is a great addition to a variety of projects, but the interface to most Bluetooth modules is through a serial UART, which can be a real bummer -- serial port availability can be limited and they're not always super-reliable. The Qwiic Bluetooth aims resolve that issue by providing an I<sup>2</sup>C interface to the HM-13 Bluetooth module.  
  
This board's HM-13 Bluetooth module supports both SPP (Serial Port Profile) and BLE (Bluetooth low-energy) Bluetooth profiles via Bluetooth 4.0. The HM-13's support for BLE means it's compatible with any smartphone.  Or you can connect it to a computer via the old standard -- SPP -- and use it as a transparent Bluetooth data gateway. You can even use it in dual-mode, connected to a pair of devices simultaneously!  
  
The board also features an ATTiny85, which has custom firmware to translate between between I<sup>2</sup>C and serial. There are a pair of Qwiic connectors, which allow you to string a variety of sensors up to a single I<sup>2</sup>C bus. Finally, a green "CON" LED indicates connection status -- blinking when disconnected and solid when connected.
