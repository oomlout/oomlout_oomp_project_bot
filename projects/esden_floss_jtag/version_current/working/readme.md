| Pin No. | Name  |  
|---------|-------|  
| 1       | +3.3V |  
| 2       |  TXD  |

The numbering of the connector is from left to right when looking from the edge  
of the board at the pins of the header.  
  
- Hardware design file notes:  
  
All designs up until version 1.0 of Floss-JTAG were  
designed in Cadsoft EAGLE. To view the files you will need to install EAGLE.  
Most of the designs are 4-layer; this means that you will need a paid version  
of the software to edit the inner layers of the board.
