The Qduino Mini is *perfect* to embed in your electronics projects, it's super small, inexpensive, has a battery connector & charger built-in, & a fuel gauge that can tell you when to charge the battery!  
  
The **Qduino Mini is Arduino-compatible & 100% open source, hardware and software** meaning that making and programming your first circuit is a breeze.  Hardware is hard, so we decided to make it a little bit easier.  All of the design files, including EAGLE board files, schematic, and code have been released under an open source license.  Here's what it includes:  
  
* **Battery Charger Circuit** - just plug in USB and it charges the battery with the auto switching circuit - there's no extra charger needed & no digging the battery out of your project so you can charge & program at the same time over USB!  
* **Battery Fuel Gauge** - guessing on when your project runs out of juice?  We've got you covered - we have a simple monitor library for your battery so you can remind yourself when it needs a little extra juice.  
* **Ultra small, Ultra thin, Ultra light** - The Qduino Mini itself is 0.8in x 1.5in (2cm x 3.9cm) & 0.18oz (5 grams), perfect for quadcopters, drones or high altitude balloon proje
