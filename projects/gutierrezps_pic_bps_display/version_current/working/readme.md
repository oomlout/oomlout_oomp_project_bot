- PIC Bench Power Supply display  
  
This is a volt/ammeter display for bench power supplies, based on PIC18F2550.  
It is originally designed as a replacement for old power supplies whose displays  
are damaged.  
  
Firmware is developed using MPLAB XC8 Compiler (through MPLAB X IDE), based  
on some of [my own libraries].  
  
Schematics and PCB are designed using [KiCAD]. Some components were taken from  
my KiCAD libraries: [gtrzps-kicad-symbols] and [gtrz.pretty].
