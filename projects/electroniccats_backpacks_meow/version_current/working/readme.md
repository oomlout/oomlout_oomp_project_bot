--- JACDAC  
  
The JACDAC Connect system uses the JACDAC (Joint Asynchronous Communications) protocol, a single cable transmission protocol for the plug and play of accessories for microcontrollers.  
  
We have adapted this technology to unlock the following benefits:  
  
- No welding between JACDAC breakouts  
- Connectors with 3.5mm audio plug to avoid connection errors.  
- Ability to create a chain in series where you can connect multiple devices.

Add wireless connection functionality to your Meow Meow thanks to bluetooth 4.0
