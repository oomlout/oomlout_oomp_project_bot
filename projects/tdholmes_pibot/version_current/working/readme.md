MicroPython based robot designed for openness, flexibility, and education.  
  
-- Design  
The PiBot is designed for simplicity, but also expandability. It is based on MicroPython at its core  
and features simple to use pre-made APIs to interface with the hardware, allowing for easy design of  
your robot.  
  
-- Hardware  
The PiBot uses:  
 - a mk20dx256vlh7 processor, just like the teensy 3.1 and 3.2  
 - a MC33926PNB motor driver  
 - pololu motors + encoders (for beta unit)
