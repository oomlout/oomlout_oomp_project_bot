This Flux Project transforms the RP2040 Stamp into a minimalistic 4x4 NeoPixel matrix. The board contains a **three-way switch**, a **Qwiic** connector, a **LiPo** connector, USB Type-C socket, and a **power switch**.  
  
As the Photo Light is powered by the Stamp, you can run **CircuitPython** on it, as well as **Arduino**.  
  
- Details  
  
Make sure you use a 3.7V/4.2V LiPo with the Photo Light.  
  
The board contains four M2.5 mounting holes, which could be used to attach a diffuser or a case to hold the battery.

These projects are also produced in smaller quantities, there is no guarantee there will be more produced in the future. Even if there is a new batch, it might differ from the initial version.   
  
These projects are in constant Flux, s
