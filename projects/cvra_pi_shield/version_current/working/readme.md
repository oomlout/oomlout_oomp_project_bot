-- Features  
  
* Power supply from 12V to 36V to 5V, 3A.  
    Powers the Raspberry Pi, and optionally the CAN bus.  
* MCP2515 CAN interface (compatible with Linux/SocketCAN) with transceiver and two connectors for daisy chaining.  
* Connector for robot's front panel LEDs (dimmable) and pushbuttons.  
* Touchscreen connector (I2C for touch, SPI for pixel data)  
* DIP switch to discriminate between robots.  
* Battery-backed Realtime Clock allows the robot to keep the time even when powered off.  
* UART console  
* Power control pins, used to cleanly shutdown the Raspberry Pi before shutting power down.  
* Socket for a 20 mm DC fan.  
* Slot to allow the use of the PiCam camera module.
