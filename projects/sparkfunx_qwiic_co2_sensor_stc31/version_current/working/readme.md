Do you need to be able to sense CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of up to 100%? If so, the STC31 is the sensor for you!  
The Sensirion STC31 thermal conductivity sensor has two CO<sub>2</sub> measurement ranges: 0 to 25 vol%; and 0 to 100 vol%.  
The measurement repeatability is 0.2 vol%, with a stability of 0.025 vol% / °C.  
The measurement accuracy depends on the measurement range: 0.5 vol% + 3% measured value; 1 vol% + 3% measured value.  
  
Our breakout includes a separate SHTC3 humidity and temperature sensor; allowing the STC31 to deliver humidity-compensated  
measurements together with improved temperature compensation. The STC31 can compensate for atmospheric pressure too - which is handy if,  
like us, you’re up in the mountains!  
  
The STC3x sensor family is Sensirion’s series of Gas Concentration sensors designed for high-volume applications.  
The STC3x utilizes a revolutionized thermal conductivity measurement principle, which results in superior repeatability and long-term stability.  
This makes the STC31 a perfect choice for applications where reliability is key.
