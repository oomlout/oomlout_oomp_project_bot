The ARTIC-R2 is an integrated low power small size ARGOS 2/3/4 single chip radio. ARTIC-R2 implements a message based wireless interface. For satellite uplink communication, ARTIC-R2 will encode, modulate and transmit provided user messages. For downlink communication, ARTIC-R2 will lock to the downstream, demodulate and decode it and extract the satellite messages.  
  
The ARTIC-R2 can transmit signals in frequency bands around 400MHz and receive signals in the bands around 466MHz, in accordance with the ARGOS satellite system specifications. The ARTIC-R2 is compliant to all ARGOS 3 and ARGOS 4 RX and TX standards. It contains a RF transceiver and frequency synthesizer and a digital baseband modem. The ARTIC-R2 contains an on-chip power amplifier delivering 1mW [0dBm] output power, that serves as an output for connecting an external high efficient PA. The (de)modulation algorithms run on an on-chip DSP. This software approach allows for re
