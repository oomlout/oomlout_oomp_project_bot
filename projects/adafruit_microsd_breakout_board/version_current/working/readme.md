Not just a simple breakout board, this microSD adapter goes the extra mile - designed for ease of use.  
  
- Onboard 5v->3v regulator provides 150mA for power-hungry cards  
- 3v level shifting means you can use this with ease on either 3v or 5v systems  
- Uses a proper level shifting chip, not resistors: less problems, and faster read/write access  
- Use 3 or 4 digital pins to read and write 2Gb+ of storage!  
- Activity LED lights up when the SD card is being read or written  
- Four -2 mounting holes  
- Push-push socket with card slightly over the edge of the PCB so its easy to insert and remove  
- Comes with 0.1" header (unattached) so you can get it on a breadboard or use wires - your choice  
- Tested and assembled here at the Adafruit factory  
- Works great with Arduino, with tons of example code and wiring diagrams
