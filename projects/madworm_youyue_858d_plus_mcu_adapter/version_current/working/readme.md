Youyue-858D+ MCU-adapter:  
=========================  
  
LAYOUT FILES: ATmega168/328 adapter board for the Youyue 858D+.

The purpose if this little board is to add an ISP header and a convenient way of adding  
more stuff via some TH solder pads.  
  
The old MCU (ATmega8) + socket are removed and replaced with a new DIP28 socket (machined pins).  
These same machined pins go into the bigger holes of the adapter board and form a  
low-profile socket for the new MCU (ATmega168). The adapter board then plugs into  
the socket on the main circuit board.
