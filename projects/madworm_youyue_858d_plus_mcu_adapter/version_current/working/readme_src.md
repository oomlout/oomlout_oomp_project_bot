Youyue-858D+ MCU-adapter:
=========================

LAYOUT FILES: ATmega168/328 adapter board for the Youyue 858D+.  

[![Adapter front](/Docs/assembled.jpg)](/Docs/assembled.jpg)

The purpose if this little board is to add an ISP header and a convenient way of adding
more stuff via some TH solder pads.

The old MCU (ATmega8) + socket are removed and replaced with a new DIP28 socket (machined pins).
These same machined pins go into the bigger holes of the adapter board and form a
low-profile socket for the new MCU (ATmega168). The adapter board then plugs into
the socket on the main circuit board.

Making any modifications to this device may cause you irreversible physical harm or worse.                                                                   
You do this at your own risk.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                             
There is a significant risk of lethal electrical shock, so if you still insist of doing so, make sure to                                                     
ALWAYS UNPLUG THE MAINS CABLE before dismantling the device. Check repeatedly.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
If you have an isolation transformer - do use it.

Before having PC-boards made, please make sure you know about your manufacturer's peculiarities!
Especially drill-sizes and their tolerances may vary too much and give you trouble.
