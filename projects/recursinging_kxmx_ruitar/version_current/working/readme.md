1. I wanted to wear it on stage while maintaining the freedom to move about.    
1. I wanted to make it myself.  
1. It didn't want to spend a fortune.  
  
I like the form factor of a guitar because it can look quite traditional in a rock band context, but upon closer inspection is clearly not.  This reflects my taste in music, superficially recognizable, but substantially deviant.  While I can play the guitar, I didn't feel it necessary that a functional [guitar be augmented](http://lividinstruments.com/products/guitar-wing/) with MIDI controller capabilities, unless the two can be [seamlessly combined](https://www.rorguitars.com/products/expressiv-midi-pro). This is primarily because my single-threaded brain just cannot effectively handle playing an instrument well, while controlling other parameters.   
  
Because a guitar hangs down in front of you, facing out, visual controls and feedback are pretty useless.  [A touch screen on the front of the guitar](https://misa-digital.myshopify.com/products/tri-bass) for example, is effectively a touch-pad for the player and a light show f
