-- Using this library  
  
There are 2 ways to use this library:   
  
1. Copy files locally into project directory (such as by making a Git Subtree)  
2. Make a reference to this git repository inside the project (such as by making a Git Submodule)

1. [Git Subtrees](UsingGitSubtree.md)  
2. [Git Submodules](UsingGitSubmodule.md)

To use these models and the ones in this repo, simply place both paths in the environment variable.  
  
Note: The path should be to the root of the repository, not the 3D directory.
