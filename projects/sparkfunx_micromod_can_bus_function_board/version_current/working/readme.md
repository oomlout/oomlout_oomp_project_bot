Controller Area Network (CAN bus) continues to be a popular communication standard in all sorts of applications from passenger vehicles to lighting control and building automation. This MicroMod function board allows you to add CAN networking to your next MicroMod project.   
  
The CAN communications are handled by the MCP2515 stand-alone CAN controller paired up with an MCP2551 high-speed CAN transceiver. The MCP2515 is a very popular IC for CAN Bus, which means there are a variety of Arduino libraries already available. We quite like Sandeep Mistry's [arduino-CAN Library](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN). If your processor board has a built-in CAN controller, however, you can change a solder jumper on the bottom of the board to address the CAN transceiver directly, bypassing the MCP2515.
