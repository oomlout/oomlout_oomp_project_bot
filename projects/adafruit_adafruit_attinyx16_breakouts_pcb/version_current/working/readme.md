--- Description  
  
These breakout boards are a "three in one" product:  
  
* The ATtinyx16 are part of the 'next gen' of AVR microcontrollers, and now we have cute development/breakout boards for them, with just enough hardware to get the chip up and running.  
* It's also an Adafruit seesaw board. Adafruit seesaw is a near-universal converter framework which allows you to add and extend hardware support to any I2C-capable microcontroller or microcomputer. Instead of getting separate I2C GPIO expanders, ADCs, PWM drivers, etc, seesaw can be configured to give a wide range of capabilities.  
* Finally, with STEMMA QT connectors on it, you could use it as either an I2C controller or peripheral with plug-and play support.  
  
We primarily designed this board for our own use: it's a mini dev board that lets us design with the ATtiny816 just like we did for the ATSAMD09. With the 2021-202
