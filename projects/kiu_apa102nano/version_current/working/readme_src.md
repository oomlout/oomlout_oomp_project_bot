I love to play around with adressable [APA102](https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/apa102/) LED strips, quickly iterating animations using the Arduino Nano.
But I am tired of wiring power, looking up which pins are SPI and having dangling wires everywhere. Time to have some boards ready for a frustration free out-of-the-box experience.

Checkout the [pics](https://github.com/kiu/apa102nano/tree/master/pics) and [hardware](https://github.com/kiu/apa102nano/tree/master/rev_a) section including BOM, Schematic, PCB layout, etc.

# Errata
I included mounting holes as an afterthought and forget to hide the silk screen "REF**" designators :/
