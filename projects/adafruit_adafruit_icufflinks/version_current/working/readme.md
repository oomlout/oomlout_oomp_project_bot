Sophisticated. Modern. Open Source. Gorgeously machined aluminum with a subtle pulsating LED. Perfect for Father's day or for that geek who loves technology and needs to get dressed up for a special event. Welcome to the future!  
  
This is a new type of product for Adafruit, we want to create wearable electronics that are subtle, fun to wear and look classy. We started with cufflinks and now have a [necklace version](http://www.adafruit.com/products/440) available too.  
  
The cufflinks are CNC machined from the finest 6 series aluminum for durability and beauty. The iCufflinks are a remarkable accessory. Machined with a "screw in backing". Each iCufflink contains a circuit board with pulsating LED and battery.  
  
--- Reverse engineered  
The "pulsing" is similar to the "breathing" LED pattern on many laptop and computer systems. The default pattern is [reverse engineered](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/08/26/reverse-engineering-the-mac-breathing-led-2/) from the Apple "breathing" LED on Macs, MacBooks, iMacs, etc.  
  
--- Open source  
Cufflinks are completely open source. [The source code, circuit board files, schematics and CAD files are posted on GitHub. Mod & Hack away! Cufflinks can be reprogrammed to any pattern you'd like!](https://github.com/adafruit/iCufflinks).  
  
--- Ready to go  
Before your fancy event, just pop the battery in, screw the backing and your iCufflin
