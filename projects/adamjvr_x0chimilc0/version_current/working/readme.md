- X0chimilc0  
Open source modular synthesizer and DSP platform  
  
X0chimilc0 is designed to be a hardware extension of Axoloti, it intends to  
use the same code base with extensions and backporting as many features as  
possible to the flagship Axoloti board. The main idea behind X0chimilc0 is to  
be nearly the same as Axoloti but with a more powerful MCU and addition of  
an FPGA based hardware sequencer. X0chimilc0 is also focused at being a mother  
board for custom hardware synthesizers. Read more about the Axoloti project
