The SparkFun Blynk Board is specially designed to work with the [Blynk mobile app](http://blynk.cc), for iOS or Android devices. Combining the Blynk Board with the Blynk app, you'll be able to easily complete a variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) based projects: control LEDs from your phone! Wire up a door switch and receive phone notifications when it opens or closes. Plug a soil moisture sensor into a plant, and have it tweet at you when it's thirsty!

All of these projects - and more! - are pre-loaded into the Blynk Board. All you have to do is provision it (using the Blynk app), and start tinkering!
