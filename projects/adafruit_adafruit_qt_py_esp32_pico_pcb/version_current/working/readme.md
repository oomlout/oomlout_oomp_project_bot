--- Description  
  
This dev board is like when you're watching a super-hero movie and the protagonist shows up in a totally amazing costume in the third act and you're like 'OMG! That's the hero and they're here to kick some serious butt!" but in this case its a microcontroller.  
  
This QT Py board is a thumbnail-sized PCB that features the ESP32 Pico V3 02, an all-in-one chip that has an ESP32 chip with dual-core 240MHz Tensilica processor, WiFi and Bluetooth classic + BLE, adds a bunch of required passives and oscillator, 8 MB of Flash memory and 2 MB of PSRAM. We add a USB to serial converter chip, some more passives, an antenna, USB C, buttons, NeoPixel and QT connector to outfit this super-hero chip for any task you want to throw it at.  
  
At the core of ESP32-PICO-V3-02 is the ESP32 (ECO V3) chip, which is a single 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chip designed with TSMCâ€™s 40 nm low-power technology. ESP32-PICO-V3-02 integrates all peripheral components seamlessly, including a crystal oscillator, flash, PSRAM, filter capacitors, and RF matching links in one single package. This makes it perfect for stuffing into such a small sp
