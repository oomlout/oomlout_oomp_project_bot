CatWAN Farmer, a grower's water saving project  
  
Monitoring soil moisture at different depths to determine when to irrigate, and - more importantly - how much water is needed. Save 25%!  
  
  
-- Main characteristics  
  
- Provide low cost, easy to build, and rugged components for optimizing agricultural irrigation.  
- DIY calibrated gypsum soil moisture sensors (Watermark SS200 is also supported).  
- Hand held sensor reader (soil moisture, soil/water salinity, water pressure).  
- Solar powered remote sensor platform.  
- 4 electrically separated inputs for soil moisture sensors.  
- LoRa module for long range (6 miles).  
- temperature/humidity sensors.  
- Solar battery charger.  
- Real time clock for sleep mode power saving and precise irrigation timing.  
- Gateway to connect multiple LoRa end nodes to the Internet.  
- Supports packet mode LoRa® (package mode) or LoRaWAN ™ Class A, B and C.  
- Compatible with Beelan, The Things Network and other LoRaWAN networks.  
- Easy reprogramming compatible with Arduino and Circuit Python.
