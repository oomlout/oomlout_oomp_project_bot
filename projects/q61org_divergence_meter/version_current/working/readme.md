ï»¿- Divergence Meter Project (by q61.org)  
  
This is yet another divergence meter project.  
  
This project tries to make a divergence meter that look just like the one in the Steins;Gate anime series, by implementing the following features:  
- Using tip-less, flat-top nixie tubes (NL902) that look similar to the tubes in the anime.  
- Compact dimensions: so that you can hold it on your hand like Suzuha does, and so that you can use the meter for cosplaying.  
- A built-in, rechargeable battery; so that Suzuha can take it out of her bag while it is displaying a divergence value.  
  
The result, a completed divergence meter can be seen below.

-- Files in This Repository  
  
This repository contains schematics, PCB files and a firmware of the divergence meter. Chassis design is left as an exercise to makers (forks and pull requests are welcome!).  
  
The divergence meter is composed of 3 PCBs, and there are 3 PCB filesets in this repository:  
- dm_control: A board that controls everything; the motherboard.  
- dm_nixiebrd: A serial-to-parallel converter board with nixie drivers. This is the board where nixie tubes are mounted on, and stacks on top of dm_control board.  
- dm_topboard: A perfboard-like board that goes on top of the divergence meter. This board does not have any electrical functions, but adds very much to the aesthetics.
