The electronic designs are all made using [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org).  
  
The actual KiCad project files are [here](Hardware/PrinterCabinet/).  
  
Rendered output (schematic and board PDFs, gerbers and bom) are [here](Hardware/Output/). (Not always up-to-date with the schematics and boards, so use with caution)
