================================
                                                                                                                                                             
Making any modifications to this device may cause you irreversible physical harm or worse.                                                                   
You do this at your own risk.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                             
There is a significant risk of lethal electrical shock, so if you still insist of doing so, make sure to                                                     
ALWAYS UNPLUG THE MAINS CABLE before dismantling the device. Check repeatedly.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                             
If you have an isolation transformer - do use it.
