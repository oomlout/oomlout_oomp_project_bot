-- Hardware  
  
PCB has been designed in KiCAD and the files are available in this repository.  
  
PCB has 2 x DC DC converters and a LiIon charger for recharging the battery.  
  
3 x ACS1115 16 bit ADCs are used for monitoring the data.  
  
  
-- Software  
  
The software has been written in C for upload via the Arduino IDE.  
  
A configuration file is used on the SD card which lets the unit know how it needs to work. Set up can easily be done 'in the field'.
