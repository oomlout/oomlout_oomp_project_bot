--- Description  
  
Our QT Py boards are a great way to make very small microcontroller projects that pack a ton of power - and now we have a way for you to add a small, colorful, and bright display to any project.  
  
Our most recent display breakouts have come with a new feature: an 18-pin "EYE SPI" standard FPC connector with flip-top connector. This is intended to be a sort-of "STEMMA QT for displays" - a way to quickly connect and extend display wiring that uses a lot of SPI pins. In this case we need a lot of SPI pins, and we want to be able to use long distances, so we go with an 18-pin 0.5mm pitch FPC.  
  
With such a slim and flexible cable, its a perfect matching for our QT Py boards to make extra smol microcontroller boards with big bold colorful displays or power-sipping E-Ink.   
  
Don't forget you'll also want an 18-pin EYESPI FPC cable. And of course one of our EYESPI displays too - look for the EYESPI logo on the back to know you've got one that can clip in.  
  
* MOSI/MISO/SCK SPI pins are connected to the default SPI port on the QT Py  
* SDA/SCL I2C pins are connected to the I2C port
