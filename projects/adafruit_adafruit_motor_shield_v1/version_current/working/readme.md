- Adafruit Motor Shield v1  
  
--- This repo is for the now ancient V1 Motor shield.  
---- This kit is now discontinued. [We've upgraded the Adafruit Motor Shield v1 to v2, with stacking-support and higher-current motor drivers, Please check out the v2 shield - its much better!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438)

Here is a design for a full-featured motor shield that will be able to power many simple to medium-complexity projects.  
  
- __2 connections for 5V 'hobby' servos__ connected to the Arduino's high-resolution dedicated timer - no jitter!  
- 4 H-Bridges: L293D chipset provides 0.6A per bridge (1.2A peak) with thermal shutdown protection, internal kickback protection diodes. Can run motors on 4.5VDC to 25VDC.  
- __Up to 4 bi-directional DC__ motors with individual 8-bit speed selection (so, about 0.5% resolution)  
- __Up to 2 stepper motors__ (unipolar or bipolar) with single coil, double coil or interleaved stepping.  
- Pull down resistors keep motors disabled during power-up  
- Big terminal block connectors to easily hook up wires (18-26AWG) and power  
- Arduino reset button brought up top  
- 2-pin terminal block and jumper to connect external power, for separate logic/motor supplies  
- Tested compatible with Arduino Mega 1280 & 2560, Diecimila, Duemilanove, and UNO  
- Download the easy-to-use Arduino software library, check out the examples and you're ready to go!
