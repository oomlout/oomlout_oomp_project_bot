This is a stereo amplifier kit designed to make use of the STA540 power amplifier IC.   
Once this kit is completed you have a fully functional, two-channel audio amplifier, complete with a standby switch,   
volume control and indicator LEDs. The kit also includes a 6400BG heatsink for the STA540 to dissipate any damaging heat.
