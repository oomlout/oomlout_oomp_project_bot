- E80-1800  
QMK compatible USB-C PCB for a Cherry G80-1800  
  
The board has been prototyped and works as intended, while fitting most G80-1800 housings. Rev 1.1 and later should fix all tolerance issues, and fit all G80-1800 (and as far as I know also G81-1800) enclosures. I can, however, not guarantee perfect operation of the PCB or compatibility with every enclosure variation - if you encounter any issues, please let me know. Rev 1.2 has not yet been tested, but changes were minimal - no issues are to be expected. Stock situations as well as component rotations at JLC may change over time and hence I can not guarantee for the BOM/CPL files to work perfectly. Please double-check before ordering!

All relevant files can be found in `E80-1800-pcb-universal\jlcpcb`. The `gerber` subfolder contains a .zip file, the `assembly` subfolder contains the BOM and POS/CPL files needed for assembly. Please double-check all component values and rotations before ordering!

Since jlcpcb usually fails to auto-determine the PCB dimensions: `382 x 160 mm` is the correct size.
