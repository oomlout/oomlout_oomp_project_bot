- Geonwork Frog TKL plate files  
  
These plate files were handed by Geon from Geonworks -- the designer of the Frog TKL -- knowing that they would be open sourced.  
  
The KiCAD files are of Gondolindrim's authorship. Everything is licensed under the Acheron Open-Hardware License v1.3 . Even so, please contact Geon before using them commercially.  
  
- Structure  
  
The ```./kicad_files``` folder contains the KiCAD files for the FR4 plates; each file should have the explanation. There are   
  
- Universal half-plate  
- ANSI half-plate  
- ISO half-plate  
- Universal full-plate  
- ANSI full-plate  
- ISO full-plate
