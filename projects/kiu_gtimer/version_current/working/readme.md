- gtimer  
gtimer is a programmable controller for the GARDENA [Fully Automatic Flower Box Watering](https://www.gardena.com/int/products/watering/holiday-watering/fully-automatic-flower-box-watering/900916701/) drip system.  
Thanks to an ATMEGA microcontroller and a RTC module very flexible watering plans can be achieved. In addition a temperature module influences the timings based on ambient temperature during the course of the day.

gtimer is a drop-in replacement for the GARDENA timer connecting to the original pump of the system.
