Need to autonomously monitor for that specific color value? Want to hone in on that magenta ball? Or follow that aquamarine line? The BH1749NUC-based Qwiic RGB Sensor is here for all of your <span style="color:red">red</span>, <span style="color:green">green</span>, <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, and <span style="color:darkred">infrared</span> color-sensing needs.  
  
The **BH1749NUC** features an I<sup>2</sup>C interface and a programmable interrupt output. It senses red, green, blue, and infrared in its field-of-view, then reports them as a 16-bit value. Additionally, it features programmable IR and RGB gains and a variable measurement rate.   
  
Also included on the breakout are individually-controllable white, red, green, and blue LEDs. The LEDs are managed with a **PCA9536** 4-channel I/O I<sup>2</sup>C expander. We've got a library for that too!  
  
Check out the documents section for a pair of Arduino libraries -- for both the [BH1749NUC](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BH1749NUC_Arduino_Library) and [PCA9536](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_PCA9536_Arduino_Library) IC's -- and a handful of examples to help get you started.
