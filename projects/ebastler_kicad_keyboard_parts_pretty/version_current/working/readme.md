-- This repository is deprecated and will not be updated. It has been replaced by [marbastlib](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib).  
Marbastlib features more components, uses the KiCAD 6.0 library formats, and is frequently updated in collaboration with   
[MarvFPV](https://github.com/marvfpv). Some of the new footprints: A full library of Cherry MX and Kailh Choc footprints (hotswap and regular, incl. stabilizers), revmount common anode RGB LEDs, WS2812B_2020, HRO Type-C M14 mid-mount-USB connectors and more.  
  
This library will remain untouched in order not to break projects that depend on it, but I would recommend switching to our new library for upcoming designs. If you find any errors, please report them to me - I will still fix errors in this library.  
  
--- Symbols:  
 * TP4056 - 1S LiIon linear battery charge/protection IC  
 * DW01A - 1S LiIon protection IC  
 * FS8205 - Dual MOSFET to be used with the DW01A  
 * XC6206PxxxMR - LDO  
 * nRF52840_holyiot_18010 - nRF52840 module from holyiot  
 * TXB0101 - 1-Bit bidirectional levelshifter  
 * WS2812B-MINI (to be used with KiCAD base SK6812MINI footprint)  
 * MX_LED - a symbol to be used with ai03s MX keyswitch lib, offering split symbols for LED and switch for cleaner matrix drawing  
 * BAV70_Small - smaller symbol to the BAV70 common cathode diode for better use in a switch matrix  
 * SK6812MINI-E - symbol for SK6812MINI-E (different pin order than regular MINI)  
  
--- Footprints  
 * ECE ESP3020 - Vertical S
