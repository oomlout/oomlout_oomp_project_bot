 [*SparkFun BadgerHack *](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/badgerhack)  
   
 These badges were designed as a soldering demo for the SparkFun booths at Maker Faire.   
 They were designed to teach the basics of PTH soldering, as well as to provide users with an Arduino platform they could take home and hack.  
   
Please view the [BadgerHack tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/badgerhack) for more information on updating the firmware, and further experiments with your badge.
