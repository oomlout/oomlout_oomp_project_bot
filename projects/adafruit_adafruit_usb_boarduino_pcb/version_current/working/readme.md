If you've ever struggled to use a solderless breadboard with an Arduino, you understand how frustrating it can be!  
  
This development board acts just like an Arduino, and works with the latest Arduino software. For many projects it can even be preferable! The kit includes all parts necessary, the assembly is straightforward and well documented, using just a soldering iron anyone can complete it within 10 or 15 minutes.  
  
This version of the Boarduino does not have a DC jack. That means you __can't__ use a 9V adapter or battery holder with it (unless you build a 5V power supply). However __it does have USB built in__ and you can power your project or USB or by using a [Mintyboost kit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/14) (which takes 2 AA batteries).  
  
Specifications:  
  
- Designed to plug into a breadboard for easy prototyping  
- Petite size, only 2.75" x 0.8" (75mm x 20mm)  
- All 'standard' pins are brought out - Digital 0-13, Analog 0-5, ARef, 5V, 3V, Ground, and Reset  
- Chip comes pre-programmed with a "no-wait" Arduino bootloader ([Read more here](https://learn.adafruit.com/arduino-tips-tricks-and-techniques/bootloader))  
- 4 LEDs! There's a green power-good LED, a red "pin 13" LED (just like the Arduino), and a pair of RX and TX indicator LEDs for debugging the serial connection  
- Nearly-all-surfacemount design. We l
