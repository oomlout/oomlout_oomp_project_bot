The SparkFun MicroMod Environmental Function Board adds additional sensing options to the MicroMod Processor Boards. This Function Board includes three sensors to monitor air quality (SGP40), humidity & temperature (SHTC3), and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (STC31) in your indoor environment. To make it even easier to use, all communication is over the MicroMod's I<sup>2</sup>C bus!  
  
* The SGP40 measures the quality of the air in your room or house. The SGP40 uses a metal oxide (MOx) sensor with a temperature controlled micro hotplate and provides a humidity-compensated volatile organic compound (VOC) based indoor air quality signal. Both the sensing element and VOC Algorithm feature an unmatched robustness against contaminating gases present in real world applications enabling a unique long term stability as well as low drift and device to device variation.  
  
* The SHTC3 is a highly accurate digital humidity and temperature sensor. The SHTC3 uses a capacitive humidity sensor with a relative humidity measurement range of 0 to 100% RH and bandgap temperature sensor wi
