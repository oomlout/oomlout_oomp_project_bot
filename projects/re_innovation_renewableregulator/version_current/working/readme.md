- Renewable Regulator  
  
- Overview  
  
This is an open-source project to design a simple, low-cost, Charge Regulator Designs for off-grid renewable energy projects.  
  
A charge-controller protects a re-chargeable battery from over (and sometime under) charging from a renewable energy resource.  
  
This controller will work as a Series and Shunt controller. Future improvements include working as a Maximum Power Point Tracking.  
The design is based upon the Arduino IDE and will use one version of the Arduino processors (Arduino Nano initially).  
Voltage is measured using a potential divider.  
Current is measured using a hall-effect current sensor.  
Temperature is measured using a 1-wire digital temperature probe.  
  
A small OLED or LCD screen is used to show the data.  
A rotary encoder is used for input data.  
Data will also be sent via a serial connection for data-logging use.
