--- Description  
  
Expand your project possibilities, with the Adafruit AW9523 GPIO Expander and LED Driver Breakout - a cute and powerful I2C expander with a lot of tricks up it's sleeve.  
  
GPIO expanders work like this: you have a board with some number of GPIO but not enough for your project - maybe you need more buttons or LEDs. You could upgrade to a board with massive number of GPIO like the Grand Central, or you could pop on one of these boards. Connect it over I2C and then you can send/receive I2C commands to control the GPIO pins to write and read them. It's going to be slower than direct GPIO access, but maybe that doesn't matter if it takes a millisecond instead of a microsecond. You only need the two I2C pins, and you can even share the I2C port with other sensors and devices. Heck, you can even add more expanders for massive I/O control!  
  
The AW9523 is a twist on the common I2C expander:  
  
* First up, its very affordable - who doesn't love that?  
* It has 16 I/O pins, that'll double most boards' pin count  
* Four I2C address options, so you can connect 4 expanders to one bus  
* Each pin can be an input or an out
