- Raspberry Pi Pico Adapter for the Keyboard FeatherWing  
  
![](./img/pico_adapter.jpg)  
  
This adapter was designed specifically to allow driving the Keyboard FeatherWing with a Raspberry Pi Pico board.  
  
Note: Because the Pico only has 3 analog pins, only A0, A1, and A5 of the Keyboard FeatherWing can actually be used to read analog values.
