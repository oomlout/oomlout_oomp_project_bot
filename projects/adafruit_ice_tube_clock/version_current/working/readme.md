This is our first clock kit design, made with a retro Russian display tube!  
  
* Cool glowing blue tube with 8 digits, PM dot and alarm on/off indicator  
* Adjustable brightness  
* Alarm with volume adjust  
* Precision watch crystal keeps time with under 20ppm (0.0002%) error (< 2 seconds a day)  
* Clear acrylic enclosure protects clock from you and you from clock  
* Battery backup will let the clock keep the time for up to 2 weeks without power  
* Selectable 12h or 24h display  
* Displays day and date on button press  
* 10 minute snooze  
* Integrated boost converter so it can run off of standard DC wall adapters, works in any country regardless of mains power  
* Great for desk or night table use, the clock measures 4.9" x 2.9" x 1.3" (12.5cm x 7.4cm x 3.3cm)  
* Completely open source hardware and software, ready to be hacked and modded!  
  
Complete kit comes with [a 110/220V 9VDC power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/products/63) (a $1 plug adapter from your local hardware store will allow it to be used worldwide), all components including PCB, vacuum fluorescent tube, backup battery and a clear acrylic enclosure. Assembly is required! This kit is made of through-hole components but is best built by someone with previous soldering experience as there are many parts and steps.
