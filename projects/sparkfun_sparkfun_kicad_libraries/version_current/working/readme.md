SparkFun Electronics KiCad Libraries  
====================================  
  
This repository contains a set of KiCad libraries that match the SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries repository, as well as tools that can be used to manipulate various aspects of KiCad libraries and footprints.  
  
**SparkFun DFM specifics**  
  
The 'standard' libraries contain internal part numbers for ease of design. Some tools also exist, like the BOM generator, which are only useful with the internal part numbers.  
  
*Note: By setting the field layer to white, the numbers become invisible*
