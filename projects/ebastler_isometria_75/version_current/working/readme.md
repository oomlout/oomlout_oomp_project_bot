- isometria<sup>75</sup>  
  
The first prototype is sitting on my desk and works perfectly - clearance for weights and battery is currently wrong, so the intended battery will not fit in the case.

 The name isometria<sup>75</sup> has it's origin in the greek noun ἰσομετρία (in latin letters: isometria), meaning "equality of measure" [[1]](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.35:6:59.LSJ). This word ended up being included in various languages, among them english (isometric), with the same meaning. I chose it for two reasons - because this keyboard is only available in an ISO layout (sorry ANSI users - for once it is ne ANSI avail), but also, because I paid attention to only use u/4 spaces throughout my board. You will have a hard time finding any distance on it that's not a multiple of 4.75 mm.
