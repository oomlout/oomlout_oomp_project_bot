- Ergogen  
  
Ergogen is a keyboard generator that aims to provide a common configuration format to describe **ergonomic** 2D layouts, and generate automatic plates, cases, and (un-routed) PCBs for them.  
The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard](https://zealot.hu/absolem), and shares its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) as well.  
  
-- Getting started  
  
Until there's a proper "Getting started" guide, try getting acquainted with ergogen by following these steps in order:  
  
1. Read the [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz). D'uuh. They're not complete by any measure, but should give you a fairly good idea what you're dealing with here.  
  
1. Try one of the web-based deployments ([official](https://ergogen.xyz); [unofficial](https://ergogen.cache.works/) but probably better and soon to be official) - no need to download the CLI unless you want to A) preview in-development features, B) use custom modifications, or C) contribute code. Click things, look at outputs; see if things start to make sense.  
  
1. Search the [`-ergogen`](https://github.com/topics/ergogen) topic on GitHub to look at (and reverse engineer) a variety of real life configs using ergogen. Pop them into the web UI, see what they do, tinker with them; things should start to make more and more sense.  
  
1. If a question persists after all of the above, feel free to ask it over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) and we'll do our best to help you out.
