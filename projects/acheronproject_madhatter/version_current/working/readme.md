-- Introduction  
  
The Mad Hatter is an Alice-layout compatible PCB, originally designed by Raphael Faria for the Lubrigante keyboard. Originally it was an Atmega32U4-powered PCB, using USB mini connector and with no per-key lighting support.  
  
It is currently under redesign by Gondolindrim to use STM32F072CBT6 microprocessor and RGB per-key lighting.  
  
-- Contributors  
  
- [Raphael Faria](https://github.com/raphaelfaria), who was the designer of the first version of the Mad Hatter PCB. His version is available as the [Omicron release](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/mad-hatter/releases/tag/Omicron).
