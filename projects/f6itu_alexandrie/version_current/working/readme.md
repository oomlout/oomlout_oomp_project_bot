Original work by Graham Haddock, KE9H and Phil Harman, VK6APH.  
  
This board supports the SPI "Alexiares" protocol (also called "J16") of   
the original Hermes SDR board designed by the OpenHPSDR group.  
  
As Alexiares was not sold anymore by the TAPR, a new and more "modular"   
design was needed by many hams wishing to play with OpenHPSDR plateforms  
(Homebrewed Hermes or Angelia boards, Steve KF7O's Hermes Lite, Red Pitaya   
supporting Pavel Denim's firmware... )   
  
Alexandrie is only needed by people using an original   
Hermes Board or a Red Pitaya (via the SPI output)  
  
A specific replacement board (Alexi2C) has been design for   
  
* Hermes, Angelia, Odyssey2, HiQSDR boards  
*  Red Pitaya owners using the I2C output  
  
3D image of the board are stored on this repo
