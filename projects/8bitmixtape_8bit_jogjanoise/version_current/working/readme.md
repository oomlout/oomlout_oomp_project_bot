- 8Bit NoiseBomb - Jogjarmageddon  
  
8Bit Mixtape goes minimal stompbox style for simple NoiseBomb!!

It is a lo-fi 8Bit noise synthesizer based on the Arduino-compatible ATTINY85, featuring 1 Pot, 1 Button and a single LED inside the potentiometer shaft. Multiple NoiseBombs can be connected to each other using CV input/output and synced to other standard gear (KORG, Pocket Operators and more).  
  
- Features  
  
-- New Bootloader for instant Noise  
  
The key feature of the new 8Bit NoiseBomb is the easiness of uploading new codes using an audio communication protocol, means just playing a .wav sound file from your computer/smart phone (or walkman). Adjust volume to 50-70% if you encounter troubles during upload.

- PCB  
  
We tried to create a PCB design that fits into a Hammond 1590A box, but also can be used stand-alone, and etched by hand single sided.
