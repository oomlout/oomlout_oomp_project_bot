The LilyPad Arduino USB is a sewable Arduino compatible board with a built-in LiPo battery charger. It connects via microUSB cable to your computer, which means that, unlike regular LilyPad boards, it needs no external hardware to be programmed.   
  
As of Arduino release 1.0.2, the LilyPad Arduino USB is supported as a native board- no additional files needed!  
  
Firmware was compiled in WinAVR-20100110.    
Hardware was developed in EAGLE 6.3.0.
