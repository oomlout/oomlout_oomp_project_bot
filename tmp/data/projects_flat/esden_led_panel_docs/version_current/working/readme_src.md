This repository contains information about different RGB LED matrix panels.

For now it contains documentation in form of KiCad schematic of RGB Panels on
the market. If you want to add your schematic to this repository, pull requests
are welcome. Please provide them only in open formats that can be easily
edited. KiCad or gEDA/PCB only, no proprietary software please. (yes this
rule also excludes Eagle, please convert your files into KiCad before
contributing, the Eagle file importer in KiCad is pretty good ;) )

If you only have a screenshot of a schematic. It would be great if you took the
time to convert it to a KiCad schematic. This way we will be able to update,
correct, improve and reuse the schamatics if needed.
